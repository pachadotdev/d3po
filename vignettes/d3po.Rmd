```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

The package `d3po` integrates well with `dplyr`. All the examples here use the 
pipe, `%>%`, both to filter/summarise data and create the charts.

# Setup

Let's start by loading packages.

```{r pkgs, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(igraph)
library(d3po)
```

# Pokemon dataset

The included dataset `pokemon` has the present structure:
```{r}
glimpse(pokemon)
```

# Box and Whiskers

To compare the distribution of `weight` by `type_1`, the `pokemon` dataset 
doesn't need additional aggregation or transformation, just to use the Pokemon
`name` as the grouping variable and (optionally) the `color` variable:
```{r box1, fig.height=7}
d3po(pokemon) %>%
  po_box(daes(x = type_1, y = speed, group = name, color = color_1)) %>%
  po_title("Distribution of Pokemon Speed by Type")
```

# Bar

Let's start by counting Pokemon by type:
```{r bar1}
pokemon_count <- pokemon %>% 
 group_by(type_1, color_1) %>% 
 count()
```

Now we can create a bar chart by using `type_1` both for the `x` axis and the
`group_by` variable provided this data has no `year` column or similar:
```{r bar2}
d3po(pokemon_count) %>%
  po_bar(
    daes(x = type_1, y = n, group = type_1, color = color_1)
  ) %>%
  po_title("Count of Pokemon by Type")
```

# Treemap

By using the `pokemon_count` table created for the bar chart, the logic is 
exactly the same and we only need to change the function and specify the `size` 
instead of `x` and `y`:
```{r}
d3po(pokemon_count) %>%
  po_treemap(
    daes(size = n, group = type_1, color = color_1)
  ) %>%
  po_title("Share of Pokemon by Type")
```

# Pie

Use these plots with caution because polar coordinates has major perceptual 
problems. Use with *EXTREME* caution.

This method is exactly the same as `treemap` but changing the function.
```{r}
d3po(pokemon_count) %>%
  po_pie(
    daes(size = n, group = type_1, color = color_1)
  ) %>%
  po_title("Share of Pokemon by Type")
```

# Line

Let's start by obtaining the decile for the Pokemon `weight` just for the 
grass, fire and water type:
```{r line1}
pokemon_decile <- pokemon %>% 
  filter(type_1 %in% c("grass", "fire", "water")) %>% 
  group_by(type_1 ,color_1) %>% 
  summarise(
    decile = 0:10,
    weight = quantile(weight, probs = seq(0, 1, by = .1))
  )
```

Now we can create an area chart by using the `variable` and `color` columns 
created above:
```{r line2}
d3po(pokemon_decile) %>%
  po_line(
    daes(x = decile, y = weight, group = type_1, color = color_1)
  ) %>%
  po_title("Decile of Pokemon Weight by Type")
```

# Area

Let's start by obtaining the density for the Pokemon `weight`:
```{r area1}
pokemon_density <- density(pokemon$weight, n = 30)

pokemon_density <- tibble(
 x = pokemon_density$x,
 y = pokemon_density$y,
 variable = "weight",
 color = "#5377e3"
)
```

Now we can create an area chart by using the `variable` and `color` columns 
created above:
```{r area2}
d3po(pokemon_density) %>%
 po_area(
  daes(x = x, y = y, group = variable, color = color)
 ) %>%
 po_title("Approximated Density of Pokemon Weight")
```

# Scatterplot

Let's explore the balance between defense and attack by Pokemon type:

```{r scatterplot1}
pokemon_def_vs_att <- pokemon %>% 
  group_by(type_1, color_1) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean_def = mean(defense),
    mean_att = mean(attack),
    n_pkmn = n()
  )

d3po(pokemon_def_vs_att) %>%
  po_scatter(
    daes(x = mean_att, y = mean_def, size = n_pkmn, group = type_1, color = color_1)
  ) %>%
  po_title("Average Attack vs Average Defense by Type")
```

# Network

This visualization method is different to the rest, as it can work with a single `data` object or `data`, `nodes` and `edges` objects by separate.

Let's create an igraph object:
```{r network1}
tr <- make_tree(40, children = 3, mode = "undirected")
```

To visualize is as simple as:
```{r network2}
d3po(tr) %>% 
  po_layout() # optional
```

Another option is to work with a `data.frame` or `tibble`:
```{r network3}
edges <- igraph::as_data_frame(tr, "edges")
```

Which is also visualized in a straightforward manner:
```{r}
d3po() %>% 
  po_edges(data = edges)
```

# Aesthetics

Going back to the treemap example, it is possible to move the labels and
also use any font that you like:
```{r}
d3po(pokemon_count) %>%
  po_treemap(
    daes(size = n, group = type_1, color = color_1, align = "left")
  ) %>%
  po_title("Share of Pokemon by Type") %>% 
  po_font("Fira Sans", 12, "uppercase") %>% 
  po_labels("left", "top", F, "Times", 30, "uppercase")
```
