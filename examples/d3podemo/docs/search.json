This is only needed for shinyAppObj, since in the shinyAppDir case, a global.R file can be used for this purpose. options Named options that should be passed to the runApp call (these can be any of the following: \"port\", \"launch.browser\", \"host\", \"quiet\", \"display.mode\" and \"test.mode\"). You can also specify width and height parameters which provide a hint to the embedding environment about the ideal height/width for the app. enableBookmarking Can be one of \"url\", \"server\", or \"disable\". The default value, NULL, will respect the setting from any previous calls to [shiny:enableBookmarking]enableBookmarking(). See [shiny:enableBookmarking]enableBookmarking() for more information on bookmarking your app. uiPattern A regular expression that will be applied to each GET request to determine whether the ui should be used to handle the request. Note that the entire request path must match the regular expression in order for the match to be considered successful. ... arguments to pass to golem_opts. See `?golem::get_golem_options` for more details. Run the Shiny Application",
